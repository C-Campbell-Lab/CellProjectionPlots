# Cell Projection Plots (CPP): a novel visualization of bone marrow aspirate cytology
Here are sample codes used in the paper titled; _Cell projection plots: a novel visualization of bone marrow aspirate cytology_

A sample CPP is shown here that shows orderly neutrophil maturation in a normal bone marrow aspirate. CPPs were evaluated by hematopathologists to check their descriptive value.

## Feature Extraction

Tissue tiles were analyzed by a YOLO model to detect cells and extract deep features. A deep feature vector was produced for each detected cell from
the corresponding region on the feature map, i.e., the first output of the modelâ€™s backbone. Average pooling was applied on the corresponding region to construct a deep feature vector of size 256 for each detected cells. These deep feature vectors represent cells.

## Cell Detection Model
A pre-trained YOLO model were repurposed to be used in this study. The model's weights can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6373429#.Y4_DUHbMKUk).
